#tiktok-username-checker

  - The original tiktok username checker was made by https://github.com/sx-kaos , that is the owner of this orgs old account, his new account is https://github.com/jwestern1337
  - This is the 3rd version of the username checker
  - writen 100% in python
  - if the username is said to be available, but is not, then it is banned
  - sadly, cannot perform ban checks on users

To get started:
  - make sure you have python installed
  - in cmd (or any terminal of your choice), do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - now you can just do `python main.py` and voila!

If you just want the compiled version, download "tiktok username checker.exe"
